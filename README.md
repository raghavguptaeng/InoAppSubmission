# comm_resources

We made this project with a vision, A vision that people would come together and share the resources in these tough times. We saw a great example of this community collaboration during 2nd wave of COVID-19 in India. Everyone came together to share their resources. But there was a problem in those conventional ways. There was no centralised platform for the same and people have to go out on various platforms for the same. To counter this we made a COMM RESOURCE application where everyone from every community across the globe can come together to share their resources in case someone in distress needs them. We plan to implement a Vaccine finder for Indian people so they don't have to search the COWIN website for hours. The Snippet for which is included in the source code under Assets/Vaccine. This vaccine finder is capable of running on raspberry pi with an LED Feedback system to monitor the programming running / error encountered.
